  title: 'Algorithm' 
  transcript: 'So having understood the Programming Elements as DATA, DATA Types, Variables, Operators and Programming Constructs - we have everything to write a simple program - isn’t it? Oh - you must be thinking that I have not taught you a single word about Ruby as a programming language till now and expecting you to write a program? :)
  No Friends - I don’t and won’t expect it from you. But we will like to share with you one very interesting and at the same time very important thing. It is a very good & recommended practice to first write set of steps in plain English language for solving a particular problem before writing an actual Program in any programming language. These set of steps written in plain English language for solving a particular problem is called an ALGORITHM. Once we write these set of steps for solving any particular problem - we know exactly what we want to achieve and how are we going to get it achieved from computer. So - morale of the story - always write an algorithm before writing an actual Program.

So let us write our first algorithm to add 2 numbers given by user & display the result of addition of these 2 numbers. 

What all things you will require for it - you will require 2 variables to hold the value of 2 no’s provided as input by user - suppose we name them as "a" & "b". We will also require a third variable for storing the value of the result of addition of these 2 no’s - lets name this variable as "c". And let us now try to write the set of steps - an algorithm - for achieving the desired result.

Step 1 - Ask user to input the value of first number to add. 

Step 2 - Store this value provided by user in variable "a". 

Step 3 - Ask user to input the value of second number to add.

Step 4 - Store this value provided by user in variable "b".

Step 5 - Add the value inside variable "a" and variable "b" & store this result into variable "c".

Step 6 - Show the value of variable "c" (which is actually the addition of 2 numbers that user did input through variable "a" & "b").

Sounds interesting friends?

To summarize - we are now comfortable with the basic elements of a Programming Language which are DATA, DATA Types, Variables, Operators and Programming Constructs. And we now also know what Algorithm is. 

Now let us try to write an algorithm to identify whether the given no is odd or even.  You also will need to help me in completing this algorithm. I will be asking you certain questions in between and we would proceed only when you give correct answers.

Step 1 - Input the value of variable "a" (Note - we are going to store the value of the no to be identified as odd or even into variable "a")
So since you have correctly answered Question 1, 2 & 3, let us write step 2 

Step 2 - Divide variable "a" by 2 and store the remainder of this division into variable "b".

Step 3 - if the value of variable "b" is 0, then display variable "a" as even number - else display variable "a" as odd number.

So if you have understood the above algorithm correctly - I have a question for you."'
