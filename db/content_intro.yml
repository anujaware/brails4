  transcript: ' Friends - Your visit to this site itself proves that you are eager to start your journey towards becoming techno-savvy.

And believe us, we need this enthusiasm only, the rest you leave it to us - we will try our best to make this journey as smooth as possible - TOGETHER WE CAN DO IT.

Your navigation in this site till this point also indicates that you want to start from the basic level.
So lets start.

Let me start with a simple question - which gadget today has taken over every single industry? - may it be a small scale or big scale industry - which gadget do you see being used everywhere you go? - may it be a Ticket booking kiosk, a Space Research Center or the smallest Shopping mall...

I am sure you all know the answer - even a primary school going kid today knows about it - its Computer.

Computer today has become an inevitable part of our life...this single gadget has changed the definition of literacy that if you donâ€™t know Computer - you are illiterate.

Let us try to understand what this computer is and the technicalities involved in it.

In literal terms - Computer is an electronic device which takes the input, stores it in memory - processes it and then produces the output.

Friends - remember this definition very well as we will need to refer it many a times throughout this journey.

Remember - our entire journey - from basics till advanced - is going to revolve around this gadget called COMPUTER.

Hence the more we become friendly with it, the easier our journey will be.

Now lets try to understand what language this Computer understands because we need to communicate with this friend of ours.

And here is the answer - This friend of ours understands only 0s and 1s. In electronic terminology, it only understands ON and OFF state. This language of 0s and 1s is called Binary Language.

You must be thinking that how can we learn or make a friendship with a gadget which only understands the language of 0s and 1s. But do not worry at all - one of the topics in our Journey ahead - called Programming Language - is going to play the role of mediator between ourselves and Computer to easily convey our messages to it.

As of now just remember that Computer understands the language of 0s and 1s (On and Off State).

Now we will try to understand what are the major components which make this Computer as a whole?

Again recall the definition of Computer - Computer is an electronic device which takes the input which can be data or instructions, stores it in memory - processes it and then produces the output.

There are 3 main things - taking the input, storing it in memory & processing it and then last is producing the output.

First aspect is taking the input - this is taken care by the Input Unit - one of the components of Computer.

This unit contains devices with the help of which we enter data into computer or give instructions to Computer. This unit makes link between user and computer.
Some of the input devices are keyboard and mouse. 

Second aspect is storing the input in memory & processing it - this is taken care by the Central Processing Unit (also called CPU). CPU is considered as the brain of the computer. CPU performs all types of data processing operations. It stores data , intermediate results and instructions(program).It controls the operation of all parts of computer.

And the third aspect is producing the output - this is taken care by the output unit - Output unit consists of devices with the help of which we get the information from computer. This unit is a link between computer and users.
Some of the Output devices are Monitor and Printer.' 
  summary: 'In this section, you will learn about -
a) What Computer is
b) Input Devices
c) Output Devices'
